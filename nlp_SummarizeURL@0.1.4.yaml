Algorithm developers can host their work on the site and charge a fee per-use to developers who integrate the algorithm into their own work. The platform encourages further additions to its library through a bounty system, which lets users request algorithms that researchers familiar with the field can contribute from their workÂ or develop from scratch for a fee."'
